# jitsi-puppeteer-basic
A forked, altered version of the Jitsi Puppeteer implementation at <https://github.com/L-wo/jitsi-puppeteer-basic>

This version is dockerised and designed to be scalable. The parameters used take from the environment and default values are found in the `.env` file.

You can access the Docker image at <https://hub.docker.com/r/jameswickenden/jitsi-puppet-video/tags>.

## Overview

This is a fork from a Jitsi Puppeteer Node.JS library which has been expanded upon.

- This project uses `python3`, `docker-compose`, `docker`, `Node.JS`, `Chrome puppeteer` and `Jitsi`, but you only need the first three installed to run.
- The Python script calls docker-compose to create a cluster of containers running the image `jameswickenden/jitsi-puppet-video`.
- This image is a Node.JS project which creates a *headed* puppeteer instance, goes to the given Jitsi Meet url, and plays a given video for a given amount of time before disconnecting.
- The audio/video files associated are .wav and .y4m, the latter of which is huge. A script is included to convert these from .mp4s with ffmpeg.

## Installation

(Note: this section relates to the original Github repo and the Node.JS server. You can ignore it unless you want to run the Node.JS scripts yourself).

These are the things I installed on my server to make it work. You probably dont need all these:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install npm chromium-browser ffmpeg -y

    sudo apt install gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils libnss3-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libxss-dev libgconf-2-4 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnss3-dev libxss-dev

Then, run this within the directory of the package:

    npm install

## Usage

With docker-compose, you can scale up clients with the command:
`docker-compose up --scale jitsi-puppet-video=0 --scale jitsi-full=x`

To create x clients at https://jitsitestservera.ddnsfree.com/many

Or with just docker, you can run `docker run jameswickenden/jitsi-puppet-video:6.0`

Note that the full client requires docker-compose to run to set up volumes. Environment variables can be found in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Video Conversion

To convert videos in MP4 format to Y4M and WAV:

    python3 mp4_splitter_ffmpeg.py [filename w/o extension]

(This is not needed; it is done inside the script)
